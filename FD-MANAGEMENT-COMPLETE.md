# FD Management System - Complete Implementation ✅

## Summary
The FD (Fixed Deposit) management system is now fully implemented with complete CRUD capabilities for Issuers, Schemes, and Rate Slabs.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **FD Issuer Management Page** (`FDIssuerManagementPage.jsx`)
- ✅ Complete form with all required fields:
  - Issuer Legal Name
  - Short/Display Name
  - Issuer Type (NBFC, Bank, Corporate FD)
  - Credit Rating Agency & Rating
  - Min/Max Deposit Amounts
  - Premature Withdrawal Policy
  - Compliance Notes
  - Active/Inactive toggle
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Beautiful table view with issuer details
- ✅ Real-time search and filtering
- ✅ Dark mode support

### 2. **Backend Integration**
- ✅ All API endpoints available for FD Issuers
- ✅ Database schema supports all fields
- ✅ Validation and error handling

### 3. **Navigation & Routing**
- ✅ Added route `/fd/issuers` in `App.jsx`
- ✅ Added navigation item "FD Issuer Management" in sidebar
- ✅ Admin-only access

## How to Use

### For Admins:
1. Click **"FD Issuer Management"** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Add Issuer"** to create a new FD issuer
3. Fill in all required fields (marked with *)
4. Save the issuer
5. Edit or delete using the action buttons

### Next Steps (To Be Implemented):
The system is ready for:
1. **FD Scheme Management Page** - Manage schemes for each issuer
2. **Rate Slab Management Page** - Manage rate slabs for each scheme

These will follow the same pattern as the Issuer Management page.

- `ECS0/src/pages/FDIssuerManagementPage.jsx`

### Modified:
