# UI Fixes Summary - FD Scheme Management

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing "Add Issuer" Button
- **Problem**: No button to create new FD issuers
- **Solution**: Added "Add FD Issuer" button to top bar in FD tab
- **Location**: Top button bar (lines 1263-1274)

### 2. ✅ Edit Buttons Not Opening Forms
- **Problem**: Clicking edit button wouldn't open the form modal
- **Solution**: Added `setShowFDSchemeForm(true)` and `setShowFDIssuerForm(true)` to edit button handlers
- **Location**: 
  - FD Issuer table edit button (line 1467)
  - FD Scheme table edit button (line 703)

### 3. ✅ Missing Edit/Delete in FD Schemes Table
- **Problem**: FD schemes table only had "View Rate Slabs" button
- **Solution**: Added Edit and Delete buttons to FD schemes table
- **Location**: FD Schemes table actions column (lines 699-716)
